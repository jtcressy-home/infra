- `STATE=$(gsd-tools.cjs query state-snapshot)`

This minimizes orchestrator context usage.

<step name="mvp_display">
**MVP-mode display (when phase has `**Mode:** mvp` in ROADMAP.md).**

Resolve `MVP_MODE` per phase via the centralized resolver. progress has no `--mvp` CLI flag (mode is inherited from the planned phase), so we omit `--cli-flag`:

```bash
MVP_MODE=$(gsd_run query phase.mvp-mode "${PHASE_NUMBER}" --pick active)
```

When `MVP_MODE=true`, the per-phase progress block adds a **user-flow status** sub-block sourced from the phase's PLAN.md task names. Each task whose name reads like a user-visible capability (e.g., "Register flow", "Login flow", "Password reset") is rendered as a status line:

```
Phase 1 — User Auth MVP
  ✅ Walking Skeleton complete           ← from SKELETON.md existence
  ✅ Register flow working               ← from PLAN.md task with summary
  ✅ Login flow working                  ← from PLAN.md task with summary
  🔄 Password reset (in progress)        ← from PLAN.md task without summary
  ⬜ Email verification                  ← from PLAN.md task not yet started
```

**User-flow filter:** Tasks whose names are technical-sounding ("Wire DB schema", "Create migration", "Bump deps") are NOT rendered as user-flow status lines. Heuristic: a task name is user-flow-shaped if it ends in "flow", "page", "screen", or starts with a verb the user would recognize ("Register", "Login", "Upload", "View"). Tasks that fail the heuristic still count toward the standard task progress total but don't appear in the user-flow sub-block.

When `MVP_MODE=false` (mode is null, absent, or the phase has no `**Mode:**` line), fall back to the standard display path — no behavioral change.
</step>

<step name="route">
**Determine next action based on verified counts.**

**Step 0: Resume-incomplete-phase invariant (Route 0)**

Before any current-phase-scoped counting, scan ALL phases for incomplete execution. This catches the case where STATE.md's `current_phase` was advanced past the phase that actually has unfinished work (common after a mid-execution session death from hang, token exhaustion, or API disruption). Without this guard, the current-phase-scoped count in Step 1 would inspect the wrong phase and the routing would skip the unfinished work.

**Skip if `--no-resume` or `--force` is present in `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.**

Scan all phases via the `$ROADMAP` JSON already loaded in `analyze_roadmap`. For each phase entry, compare `plans` length to `summaries` length using the same plans-without-summaries predicate as `determine_next_action` Route 4 (`plans.length > summaries.length`). Stop at the first (lowest-numbered) phase where the predicate is true. Record its phase number as `INCOMPLETE_PHASE`.

If `$ROADMAP` is empty or the query failed, surface a warning rather than silently proceeding:

```bash
INCOMPLETE_PHASE=""
if [ -z "$ROADMAP" ]; then
  echo "⚠ WARNING: resume-incomplete-phase scan could not run (\$ROADMAP is empty)." >&2
  echo "  The incomplete-phase invariant (#160) could not be verified." >&2
  echo "  Review project state carefully before continuing." >&2
else
  for PHASE_NUM in $(echo "$ROADMAP" | jq -r '.phases[] | (.number // .phase_number)'); do
    PHASE_DATA=$(echo "$ROADMAP" | jq --arg n "$PHASE_NUM" '.phases[] | select((.number // .phase_number) == ($n | tonumber))')
    PLAN_COUNT=$(echo "$PHASE_DATA" | jq '(.plans // []) | length')
    SUMMARY_COUNT=$(echo "$PHASE_DATA" | jq '(.summaries // []) | length')
    if [ "${PLAN_COUNT:-0}" -gt "${SUMMARY_COUNT:-0}" ]; then
      INCOMPLETE_PHASE="$PHASE_NUM"
      break
    fi
  done
fi
```

**If `INCOMPLETE_PHASE` is non-empty:** emit a one-line resume notice in the routing output and route to `$gsd-execute-phase ${INCOMPLETE_PHASE}` instead of running Step 1's current-phase routing. The progress report (already displayed by the `report` step above) gives the user full project status before this routing decision is shown.

```
---

## ▶ Next Up — Resuming incomplete Phase ${INCOMPLETE_PHASE}

`$gsd-execute-phase ${INCOMPLETE_PHASE} ${GSD_WS}`

(plans without summaries detected; use --no-resume to skip this check and route by current_phase instead; --force to skip all gates)

---
```

Then exit the route step. Do NOT run Steps 1 through Routes A-F.

**If `INCOMPLETE_PHASE` is empty:** continue to Step 1.

**Step 1: Count plans, summaries, and issues in current phase**

List files in the current phase directory:

```bash
(ls -1 .planning/phases/[current-phase-dir]/*-PLAN.md 2>/dev/null || true) | wc -l
(ls -1 .planning/phases/[current-phase-dir]/*-SUMMARY.md 2>/dev/null || true) | wc -l
(ls -1 .planning/phases/[current-phase-dir]/*-UAT.md 2>/dev/null || true) | wc -l
```

State: "This phase has {X} plans, {Y} summaries."

**Step 1.5: Check for unaddressed UAT gaps**

Check for UAT.md files with status "diagnosed" (has gaps needing fixes).

```bash
# Check for diagnosed UAT with gaps or partial (incomplete) testing
grep -l "status: diagnosed\|status: partial" .planning/phases/[current-phase-dir]/*-UAT.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

Track:
- `uat_with_gaps`: UAT.md files with status "diagnosed" (gaps need fixing)
- `uat_partial`: UAT.md files with status "partial" (incomplete testing)

**Step 1.6: Cross-phase health check**

Scan ALL phases in the current milestone for outstanding verification debt using the CLI (which respects milestone boundaries via `getMilestonePhaseFilter`):

```bash
DEBT=$(gsd_run query audit-uat --raw 2>/dev/null)
```

Parse JSON for `summary.total_items` and `summary.total_files`.

Track: `outstanding_debt` — `summary.total_items` from the audit.

**If outstanding_debt > 0:** Add a warning section to the progress report output (in the `report` step), placed between "## What's Next" and the route suggestion:

```markdown
## Verification Debt ({N} files across prior phases)

| Phase | File | Issue |
|-------|------|-------|
| {phase} | {filename} | {pending_count} pending, {skipped_count} skipped, {blocked_count} blocked |
| {phase} | {filename} | human_needed — {count} items |

Review: `$gsd-audit-uat ${GSD_WS}` — full cross-phase audit
Resume testing: `$gsd-verify-work {phase} ${GSD_WS}` — retest specific phase
```

This is a WARNING, not a blocker — routing proceeds normally. The debt is visible so the user can make an informed choice.

**Step 1.7: Check verification status for the current phase**

A phase whose verification is missing, unknown, `gaps_found`, or `human_needed` is NOT complete, even when every PLAN.md has a matching SUMMARY.md. The count-based status (`roadmap.analyze`) only sees plans/summaries, so without this check such a phase is reported complete and routing skips straight to the next phase. When the phase appears count-complete (`summaries = plans AND plans > 0`), consult the verification report (the same `verification.status` gate `ship` and `execute-phase` use, from #651):

```bash
PHASE_DIR=".planning/phases/[current-phase-dir]"
VERIFICATION=$(gsd_run query verification.status "${PHASE_DIR}" 2>/dev/null)
VERIFICATION_STATUS=$(printf '%s' "$VERIFICATION" | jq -r '.status' 2>/dev/null || echo "")
VERIFICATION_NEXT_ACTION=$(printf '%s' "$VERIFICATION" | jq -r '.next_action' 2>/dev/null || echo "")
```

Track: `verification_status` — the `.status` field (`passed | stale | gaps_found | human_needed | missing | unknown`). The query/projection handles a missing VERIFICATION.md (`missing`), unexpected values, and stale verification (`stale`, when summaries are newer than verification). Only `passed` routes as phase complete (Step 3); every other status routes back to close verification debt (Step 2).

**Step 2: Route based on counts**

| Condition | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| uat_partial > 0 | UAT testing incomplete | Go to **Route E.2** |
| uat_with_gaps > 0 | UAT gaps need fix plans | Go to **Route E** |
| summaries < plans | Unexecuted plans exist | Go to **Route A** |
| summaries = plans AND plans > 0 AND verification_status = missing | Phase executed; verification report missing | Go to **Route V.missing** |
| summaries = plans AND plans > 0 AND verification_status = unknown | Phase executed; verification status unknown | Go to **Route V.unknown** |
| summaries = plans AND plans > 0 AND verification_status = stale | Phase executed; verification is stale | Go to **Route V.stale** |
| summaries = plans AND plans > 0 AND verification_status = gaps_found | Phase executed; verification found gaps | Go to **Route V.gaps** |
| summaries = plans AND plans > 0 AND verification_status = human_needed | Phase executed; awaiting human verification | Go to **Route V.human** |
| summaries = plans AND plans > 0 AND verification_status = passed | Phase complete (verification passed) | Go to Step 3 |
| plans = 0 | Phase not yet planned | Go to **Route B** |

Rows are evaluated top to bottom; the first matching row wins. The `verification_status` rows must precede the passed row so non-`passed` verification is not reported as complete.

**Step 3: Check milestone status (only when phase complete)**

Read ROADMAP.md and identify:
1. Current phase number
2. All phase numbers in the current milestone section

Count total phases and identify the highest phase number.

State: "Current phase is {X}. Milestone has {N} phases (highest: {Y})."

**Route based on milestone status:**

**Route C: Phase complete, more phases remain**

Read ROADMAP.md to get the next phase's name and goal.

Check if next phase has UI indicators:

- Phase complete but next phase not planned → offer `$gsd-plan-phase [next] ${GSD_WS}`
- All work complete → offer milestone completion
- Blockers present → highlight before offering to continue
- Handoff file exists → mention it, offer `$gsd-resume-work ${GSD_WS}`
</step>

<step name="forensic_audit">
**Forensic Integrity Audit** — only runs when `--forensic` is present in ARGUMENTS.

If `--forensic` is NOT present in ARGUMENTS: skip this step entirely. Default progress behavior (standard report + routing) is unchanged.

If `--forensic` IS present: after the standard report and routing suggestion have been displayed, append the following audit section.

## Forensic Integrity Audit

Running 6 deep checks against project state...

Run each check in order. For each check, emit ✓ (pass) or ⚠ (warning) with concrete evidence when a problem is found.

**Check 1 — STATE vs artifact consistency**

Read STATE.md `status` / `stopped_at` fields (from the STATE snapshot already loaded). Compare against the artifact count from the roadmap analysis. If STATE.md claims the current phase is pending/mid-flight but the artifact count shows it as complete (all PLAN.md files have matching SUMMARY.md files), flag inconsistency. Emit:
- ✓ `STATE.md consistent with artifact count` — if both agree
- ⚠ `STATE.md claims [status] but artifact count shows phase complete` — with the specific values

**Check 2 — Orphaned handoff files**

Check for existence of:
```bash
ls .planning/HANDOFF.json .planning/phases/*/.continue-here.md .planning/phases/*/*HANDOFF*.md 2>/dev/null || true
```
Also check `.planning/continue-here.md`.

Emit:
- ✓ `No orphaned handoff files` — if none found
- ⚠ `Orphaned handoff files found` — list each file path, add: `→ Work was paused mid-flight. Read the handoff before continuing.`

**Check 3 — Deferred scope drift**

Search phase artifacts (CONTEXT.md, DISCUSSION-LOG.md, BUG-BRIEF.md, VERIFICATION.md, SUMMARY.md, HANDOFF.md files under `.planning/phases/`) for patterns:
```bash
grep -rl "defer to Phase\|future phase\|out of scope Phase\|deferred to Phase" .planning/phases/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

For each match, extract the referenced phase number. Cross-reference against ROADMAP.md phase list. If the referenced phase number is NOT in ROADMAP.md, flag as deferred scope not captured.

Emit:
- ✓ `All deferred scope captured in ROADMAP` — if no mismatches
- ⚠ `Deferred scope references phase(s) not in ROADMAP` — list: file, reference text, missing phase number

**Check 4 — Memory-flagged pending work**

Check if `.planning/MEMORY.md` or `.planning/memory/` exists:
```bash
ls .planning/MEMORY.md .planning/memory/*.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

If found, grep for entries containing: `pending`, `status`, `deferred`, `not yet run`, `backfill`, `blocking`.

Emit:
- ✓ `No memory entries flagging pending work` — if none found or no MEMORY.md
- ⚠ `Memory entries flag pending/deferred work` — list the matching lines (max 5, truncated at 80 chars)

**Check 5 — Blocking operational todos**

Check for pending todos:
```bash
ls .planning/todos/pending/*.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

For files found, scan for keywords indicating operational blockers: `script`, `credential`, `API key`, `manual`, `verification`, `setup`, `configure`, `run `.

Emit:
- ✓ `No blocking operational todos` — if no pending todos or none match operational keywords
- ⚠ `Blocking operational todos found` — list the file names and matching keywords (max 5)

**Check 6 — Uncommitted code**

```bash
git status --porcelain 2>/dev/null | grep -v "^??" | grep -v "^.planning\/" | grep -v "^\.\." | head -10
```

If output is non-empty (modified/staged files outside `.planning/`), flag as uncommitted code.

Emit:
- ✓ `Working tree clean` — if no modified files outside `.planning/`
- ⚠ `Uncommitted changes in source files` — list up to 10 file paths

---

After all 6 checks, display the verdict:

**If all 6 checks passed:**
```
### Verdict: CLEAN

The standard progress report is trustworthy — proceed with the routing suggestion above.
```

**If 1 or more checks failed:**
```
### Verdict: N INTEGRITY ISSUE(S) FOUND

The standard progress report may not reflect true project state.
Review the flagged items above before acting on the routing suggestion.
```

Then for each failed check, add a concrete next action:
- Check 2 (orphaned handoff): `Read the handoff file(s) and resume from where work was paused: $gsd-resume-work ${GSD_WS}`
- Check 3 (deferred scope): `Add the missing phases to ROADMAP.md or update the deferred references`
- Check 4 (memory pending): `Review the flagged memory entries and resolve or clear them`
- Check 5 (blocking todos): `Complete the operational steps in .planning/todos/pending/ before continuing`
- Check 6 (uncommitted code): `Commit or stash the uncommitted changes before advancing`
- Check 1 (STATE inconsistency): `Run $gsd-verify-work ${PHASE} ${GSD_WS} to reconcile state`
</step>
