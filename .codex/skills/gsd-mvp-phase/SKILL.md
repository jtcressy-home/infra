## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked by mentioning `$gsd-mvp-phase`.
- Treat all user text after `$gsd-mvp-phase` as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. AskUserQuestion → request_user_input Mapping
GSD workflows use `AskUserQuestion` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex `request_user_input`:

Parameter mapping:
- `header` → `header`
- `question` → `question`
- Options formatted as `"Label" — description` → `{label: "Label", description: "description"}`
- Generate `id` from header: lowercase, replace spaces with underscores

Batched calls:
- `AskUserQuestion([q1, q2])` → single `request_user_input` with multiple entries in `questions[]`

Multi-select workaround:
- Codex has no `multiSelect`. Use sequential single-selects, or present a numbered freeform list asking the user to enter comma-separated numbers.

Execute mode fallback:
- When `request_user_input` is rejected or unavailable, you MUST stop and present the questions as a plain-text numbered list, then wait for the user's reply. Do NOT pick a default and continue (#3018).
- You may only proceed without a user answer when one of these is true:
  (a) the invocation included an explicit non-interactive flag (`--auto` or `--all`),
  (b) the user has explicitly approved a specific default for this question, or
  (c) the workflow's documented contract says defaults are safe (e.g. autonomous lifecycle paths).
- Do NOT write workflow artifacts (CONTEXT.md, DISCUSSION-LOG.md, PLAN.md, checkpoint files) until the user has answered the plain-text questions or one of (a)-(c) above applies. Surfacing the questions and waiting is the correct response — silently defaulting and writing artifacts is the #3018 failure mode.

## C. Task() → spawn_agent Mapping
GSD workflows use `Task(...)` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex collaboration tools:

Direct mapping:
- `Task(subagent_type="X", prompt="Y")` → `spawn_agent(agent_type="X", message="Y")`
- `Task(model="...")` → omit. `spawn_agent` has no inline `model` parameter;
  GSD embeds the resolved per-agent model directly into each agent's `.toml`
  at install time so `model_overrides` from `.planning/config.json` and
  `~/.gsd/defaults.json` are honored automatically by Codex's agent router.
- `fork_context: false` by default — GSD agents load their own context via `<files_to_read>` blocks

Spawn restriction:
- Codex restricts `spawn_agent` to cases where the user has explicitly
  requested sub-agents. When automatic spawning is not permitted, do the
  work inline in the current agent rather than attempting to force a spawn.

Parallel fan-out:
- Spawn multiple agents → collect agent IDs → `wait(ids)` for all to complete

Result parsing:
- Look for structured markers in agent output: `CHECKPOINT`, `PLAN COMPLETE`, `SUMMARY`, etc.
- `close_agent(id)` after collecting results from each agent

<objective>
Guide the user through MVP-mode planning for a phase. The command:

1. Prompts for an "As a / I want to / So that" user story (three structured questions)
2. Runs SPIDR splitting check — if the story is too large, walks through Spike/Paths/Interfaces/Data/Rules and offers to split into multiple phases
3. Writes `**Mode:** mvp` and the reformatted `**Goal:**` to the phase's ROADMAP.md section
4. Delegates to `/gsd plan-phase <N>` which auto-detects MVP mode via the roadmap field

Phase 1 of the vertical-mvp-slice PRD shipped the planner-side machinery; this command is the user entry point for it.

<runtime_note>
**Copilot (VS Code):** Use `vscode_askquestions` wherever this workflow calls `AskUserQuestion`. Equivalent API.
</runtime_note>

<context>
Phase number: {{GSD_ARGS}} (required — integer or decimal like `2.1`)

The phase must already exist in ROADMAP.md (created via `/gsd new-project`, `/gsd add-phase`, or `/gsd insert-phase`). This command does not create new phases — it converts an existing phase to MVP mode.
</context>

<process>
Execute the mvp-phase workflow from @/Users/jtcressy/.codex/worktrees/bfc5/infra/.codex/get-shit-done/workflows/mvp-phase.md end-to-end.
Preserve all gates: phase existence, status guard (refuse in_progress/completed), user-story format validation, SPIDR splitting check, ROADMAP write confirmation, plan-phase delegation.
</process>
