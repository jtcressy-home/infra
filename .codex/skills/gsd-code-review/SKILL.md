## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked by mentioning `$gsd-code-review`.
- Treat all user text after `$gsd-code-review` as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. AskUserQuestion → request_user_input Mapping
GSD workflows use `AskUserQuestion` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex `request_user_input`:

Parameter mapping:
- `header` → `header`
- `question` → `question`
- Options formatted as `"Label" — description` → `{label: "Label", description: "description"}`
- Generate `id` from header: lowercase, replace spaces with underscores

Batched calls:
- `AskUserQuestion([q1, q2])` → single `request_user_input` with multiple entries in `questions[]`

Multi-select workaround:
- Codex has no `multiSelect`. Use sequential single-selects, or present a numbered freeform list asking the user to enter comma-separated numbers.

Execute mode fallback:
- When `request_user_input` is rejected or unavailable, you MUST stop and present the questions as a plain-text numbered list, then wait for the user's reply. Do NOT pick a default and continue (#3018).
- You may only proceed without a user answer when one of these is true:
  (a) the invocation included an explicit non-interactive flag (`--auto` or `--all`),
  (b) the user has explicitly approved a specific default for this question, or
  (c) the workflow's documented contract says defaults are safe (e.g. autonomous lifecycle paths).
- Do NOT write workflow artifacts (CONTEXT.md, DISCUSSION-LOG.md, PLAN.md, checkpoint files) until the user has answered the plain-text questions or one of (a)-(c) above applies. Surfacing the questions and waiting is the correct response — silently defaulting and writing artifacts is the #3018 failure mode.

## C. Task() → spawn_agent Mapping
GSD workflows use `Task(...)` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex collaboration tools:

Direct mapping:
- `Task(subagent_type="X", prompt="Y")` → `spawn_agent(agent_type="X", message="Y")`
- `Task(model="...")` → omit. `spawn_agent` has no inline `model` parameter;
  GSD embeds the resolved per-agent model directly into each agent's `.toml`
  at install time so `model_overrides` from `.planning/config.json` and
  `~/.gsd/defaults.json` are honored automatically by Codex's agent router.
- `fork_context: false` by default — GSD agents load their own context via `<files_to_read>` blocks

Spawn restriction:
- Codex restricts `spawn_agent` to cases where the user has explicitly
  requested sub-agents. When automatic spawning is not permitted, do the
  work inline in the current agent rather than attempting to force a spawn.

Parallel fan-out:
- Spawn multiple agents → collect agent IDs → `wait(ids)` for all to complete

Result parsing:
- Look for structured markers in agent output: `CHECKPOINT`, `PLAN COMPLETE`, `SUMMARY`, etc.
- `close_agent(id)` after collecting results from each agent

<objective>
Review source files changed during a phase for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code quality problems.

Spawns the gsd-code-reviewer agent to analyze code at the specified depth level. Produces REVIEW.md artifact in the phase directory with severity-classified findings.

Arguments:
- Phase number (required) — which phase's changes to review (e.g., "2" or "02")
- `--depth=quick|standard|deep` (optional) — review depth level, overrides workflow.code_review_depth config
  - quick: Pattern-matching only (~2 min)
  - standard: Per-file analysis with language-specific checks (~5-15 min, default)
  - deep: Cross-file analysis including import graphs and call chains (~15-30 min)
- `--files file1,file2,...` (optional) — explicit comma-separated file list, skips SUMMARY/git scoping (highest precedence for scoping)
- `--fix` (optional) — after review completes (or if REVIEW.md already exists), auto-apply fixes found. Spawns gsd-code-fixer agent. Accepts sub-flags:
  - `--all` — include Info findings in fix scope (default: Critical + Warning only)
  - `--auto` — enable fix + re-review iteration loop, capped at 3 iterations

Output: {padded_phase}-REVIEW.md in phase directory + inline summary of findings
</objective>

<execution_context>
@/Users/jtcressy/.codex/worktrees/bfc5/infra/.codex/get-shit-done/workflows/code-review.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Phase: {{GSD_ARGS}} (first positional argument is phase number)

Optional flags parsed from {{GSD_ARGS}}:
- `--depth=VALUE` — Depth override (quick|standard|deep). If provided, overrides workflow.code_review_depth config.
- `--files=file1,file2,...` — Explicit file list override. Has highest precedence for file scoping per D-08. When provided, workflow skips SUMMARY.md extraction and git diff fallback entirely.

Context files (AGENTS.md, SUMMARY.md, phase state) are resolved inside the workflow via `gsd-sdk query init.phase-op` and delegated to agent via `<files_to_read>` blocks.
</context>

<process>
This command is a thin dispatch layer. It parses arguments and delegates to the workflow.

Execute end-to-end.

The workflow (not this command) enforces these gates:
- Phase validation (before config gate)
- Config gate check (workflow.code_review)
- File scoping (--files override > SUMMARY.md > git diff fallback)
- Empty scope check (skip if no files)
- Agent spawning (gsd-code-reviewer)
- Result presentation (inline summary + next steps)
</process>
