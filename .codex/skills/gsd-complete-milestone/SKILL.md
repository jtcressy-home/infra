## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked by mentioning `$gsd-complete-milestone`.
- Treat all user text after `$gsd-complete-milestone` as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. AskUserQuestion → request_user_input Mapping
GSD workflows use `AskUserQuestion` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex `request_user_input`:

Parameter mapping:
- `header` → `header`
- `question` → `question`
- Options formatted as `"Label" — description` → `{label: "Label", description: "description"}`
- Generate `id` from header: lowercase, replace spaces with underscores

Batched calls:
- `AskUserQuestion([q1, q2])` → single `request_user_input` with multiple entries in `questions[]`

Multi-select workaround:
- Codex has no `multiSelect`. Use sequential single-selects, or present a numbered freeform list asking the user to enter comma-separated numbers.

Execute mode fallback:
- When `request_user_input` is rejected or unavailable, you MUST stop and present the questions as a plain-text numbered list, then wait for the user's reply. Do NOT pick a default and continue (#3018).
- You may only proceed without a user answer when one of these is true:
  (a) the invocation included an explicit non-interactive flag (`--auto` or `--all`),
  (b) the user has explicitly approved a specific default for this question, or
  (c) the workflow's documented contract says defaults are safe (e.g. autonomous lifecycle paths).
- Do NOT write workflow artifacts (CONTEXT.md, DISCUSSION-LOG.md, PLAN.md, checkpoint files) until the user has answered the plain-text questions or one of (a)-(c) above applies. Surfacing the questions and waiting is the correct response — silently defaulting and writing artifacts is the #3018 failure mode.

## C. Task() → spawn_agent Mapping
GSD workflows use `Task(...)` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex collaboration tools:

Direct mapping:
- `Task(subagent_type="X", prompt="Y")` → `spawn_agent(agent_type="X", message="Y")`
- `Task(model="...")` → omit. `spawn_agent` has no inline `model` parameter;
  GSD embeds the resolved per-agent model directly into each agent's `.toml`
  at install time so `model_overrides` from `.planning/config.json` and
  `~/.gsd/defaults.json` are honored automatically by Codex's agent router.
- `fork_context: false` by default — GSD agents load their own context via `<files_to_read>` blocks

Spawn restriction:
- Codex restricts `spawn_agent` to cases where the user has explicitly
  requested sub-agents. When automatic spawning is not permitted, do the
  work inline in the current agent rather than attempting to force a spawn.

Parallel fan-out:
- Spawn multiple agents → collect agent IDs → `wait(ids)` for all to complete

Result parsing:
- Look for structured markers in agent output: `CHECKPOINT`, `PLAN COMPLETE`, `SUMMARY`, etc.
- `close_agent(id)` after collecting results from each agent

<objective>
Mark milestone {{version}} complete, archive to milestones/, and update ROADMAP.md and REQUIREMENTS.md.

Purpose: Create historical record of shipped version, archive milestone artifacts (roadmap + requirements), and prepare for next milestone.
Output: Milestone archived (roadmap + requirements), PROJECT.md evolved, git tagged.
</objective>

<execution_context>
**Load these files NOW (before proceeding):**

- @/Users/jtcressy/.codex/worktrees/bfc5/infra/.codex/get-shit-done/workflows/complete-milestone.md (main workflow)
- @/Users/jtcressy/.codex/worktrees/bfc5/infra/.codex/get-shit-done/templates/milestone-archive.md (archive template)
  </execution_context>

<context>
**Project files:**
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`
- `.planning/STATE.md`
- `.planning/PROJECT.md`

**User input:**

- Version: {{version}} (e.g., "1.0", "1.1", "2.0")
  </context>

<process>

**Follow complete-milestone.md workflow:**

0. **Check for audit:**

   - Look for `.planning/v{{version}}-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`
   - If missing or stale: recommend `$gsd-audit-milestone` first
   - If audit status is `gaps_found`: recommend closing the gaps inline
     (the audit output already enumerates them — insert closure phases
     via `$gsd-phase --insert <N>` plus the standard
     discuss/plan/execute chain) before proceeding.
   - If audit status is `passed`: proceed to step 1

   ```markdown
   ## Pre-flight Check

   {If no v{{version}}-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md:}
   ⚠ No milestone audit found. Run `$gsd-audit-milestone` first to verify
   requirements coverage, cross-phase integration, and E2E flows.

   {If audit has gaps:}
   ⚠ Milestone audit found gaps. The audit output already enumerates the
   unsatisfied requirements, cross-phase issues, and broken flows — insert
   a closure phase per gap with `$gsd-phase --insert <N>` and run the
   standard `$gsd-discuss-phase` → `$gsd-plan-phase` → `$gsd-execute-phase`
   chain. Or proceed anyway to accept the gaps as tech debt.

   {If audit passed:}
   ✓ Milestone audit passed. Proceeding with completion.
   ```

1. **Verify readiness:**

   - Check all phases in milestone have completed plans (SUMMARY.md exists)
   - Present milestone scope and stats
   - Wait for confirmation

2. **Gather stats:**

   - Count phases, plans, tasks
   - Calculate git range, file changes, LOC
   - Extract timeline from git log
   - Present summary, confirm

3. **Extract accomplishments:**

   - Read all phase SUMMARY.md files in milestone range
   - Extract 4-6 key accomplishments
   - Present for approval

4. **Archive milestone:**

   - Create `.planning/milestones/v{{version}}-ROADMAP.md`
   - Extract full phase details from ROADMAP.md
   - Fill milestone-archive.md template
   - Update ROADMAP.md to one-line summary with link

5. **Archive requirements:**

   - Create `.planning/milestones/v{{version}}-REQUIREMENTS.md`
   - Mark all v1 requirements as complete (checkboxes checked)
   - Note requirement outcomes (validated, adjusted, dropped)
   - Delete `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` (fresh one created for next milestone)

6. **Update PROJECT.md:**

   - Add "Current State" section with shipped version
   - Add "Next Milestone Goals" section
   - Archive previous content in `<details>` (if v1.1+)

7. **Commit and tag:**

   - Stage: MILESTONES.md, PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, archive files
   - Commit: `chore: archive v{{version}} milestone`
   - Tag: `git tag -a v{{version}} -m "[milestone summary]"`
   - Ask about pushing tag

8. **Offer next steps:**
   - `$gsd-new-milestone` — start next milestone (questioning → research → requirements → roadmap)

</process>

<success_criteria>

- Milestone archived to `.planning/milestones/v{{version}}-ROADMAP.md`
- Requirements archived to `.planning/milestones/v{{version}}-REQUIREMENTS.md`
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` deleted (fresh for next milestone)
- ROADMAP.md collapsed to one-line entry
- PROJECT.md updated with current state
- Git tag v{{version}} created
- Commit successful
- User knows next steps (including need for fresh requirements)
  </success_criteria>

<critical_rules>

- **Load workflow first:** Read complete-milestone.md before executing
- **Verify completion:** All phases must have SUMMARY.md files
- **User confirmation:** Wait for approval at verification gates
- **Archive before deleting:** Always create archive files before updating/deleting originals
- **One-line summary:** Collapsed milestone in ROADMAP.md should be single line with link
- **Context efficiency:** Archive keeps ROADMAP.md and REQUIREMENTS.md constant size per milestone
- **Fresh requirements:** Next milestone starts with `$gsd-new-milestone` which includes requirements definition
  </critical_rules>
