## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked by mentioning `$gsd-review-backlog`.
- Treat all user text after `$gsd-review-backlog` as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. AskUserQuestion → request_user_input Mapping
GSD workflows use `AskUserQuestion` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex `request_user_input`:

Parameter mapping:
- `header` → `header`
- `question` → `question`
- Options formatted as `"Label" — description` → `{label: "Label", description: "description"}`
- Generate `id` from header: lowercase, replace spaces with underscores

Batched calls:
- `AskUserQuestion([q1, q2])` → single `request_user_input` with multiple entries in `questions[]`

Multi-select workaround:
- Codex has no `multiSelect`. Use sequential single-selects, or present a numbered freeform list asking the user to enter comma-separated numbers.

Execute mode fallback:
- When `request_user_input` is rejected or unavailable, you MUST stop and present the questions as a plain-text numbered list, then wait for the user's reply. Do NOT pick a default and continue (#3018).
- You may only proceed without a user answer when one of these is true:
  (a) the invocation included an explicit non-interactive flag (`--auto` or `--all`),
  (b) the user has explicitly approved a specific default for this question, or
  (c) the workflow's documented contract says defaults are safe (e.g. autonomous lifecycle paths).
- Do NOT write workflow artifacts (CONTEXT.md, DISCUSSION-LOG.md, PLAN.md, checkpoint files) until the user has answered the plain-text questions or one of (a)-(c) above applies. Surfacing the questions and waiting is the correct response — silently defaulting and writing artifacts is the #3018 failure mode.

## C. Task() → spawn_agent Mapping
GSD workflows use `Task(...)` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex collaboration tools:

Direct mapping:
- `Task(subagent_type="X", prompt="Y")` → `spawn_agent(agent_type="X", message="Y")`
- `Task(model="...")` → omit. `spawn_agent` has no inline `model` parameter;
  GSD embeds the resolved per-agent model directly into each agent's `.toml`
  at install time so `model_overrides` from `.planning/config.json` and
  `~/.gsd/defaults.json` are honored automatically by Codex's agent router.
- `fork_context: false` by default — GSD agents load their own context via `<files_to_read>` blocks

Spawn restriction:
- Codex restricts `spawn_agent` to cases where the user has explicitly
  requested sub-agents. When automatic spawning is not permitted, do the
  work inline in the current agent rather than attempting to force a spawn.

Parallel fan-out:
- Spawn multiple agents → collect agent IDs → `wait(ids)` for all to complete

Result parsing:
- Look for structured markers in agent output: `CHECKPOINT`, `PLAN COMPLETE`, `SUMMARY`, etc.
- `close_agent(id)` after collecting results from each agent

<objective>
Review all 999.x backlog items and optionally promote them into the active
milestone sequence or remove stale entries.
</objective>

<process>

1. **List backlog items:**
   ```bash
   ls -d .planning/phases/999* 2>/dev/null || echo "No backlog items found"
   ```

2. **Read ROADMAP.md** and extract all 999.x phase entries:
   ```bash
   cat .planning/ROADMAP.md
   ```
   Show each backlog item with its description, any accumulated context (CONTEXT.md, RESEARCH.md), and creation date.

3. **Present the list to the user** via AskUserQuestion:
   - For each backlog item, show: phase number, description, accumulated artifacts
   - Options per item: **Promote** (move to active), **Keep** (leave in backlog), **Remove** (delete)

4. **For items to PROMOTE:**
   - Find the next sequential phase number in the active milestone
   - Rename the directory from `999.x-slug` to `{new_num}-slug`:
     ```bash
     NEW_NUM=$(gsd-sdk query phase.add "${DESCRIPTION}" --raw)
     ```
   - Move accumulated artifacts to the new phase directory
   - Update ROADMAP.md: move the entry from `## Backlog` section to the active phase list
   - Remove `(BACKLOG)` marker
   - Add appropriate `**Depends on:**` field

5. **For items to REMOVE:**
   - Delete the phase directory
   - Remove the entry from ROADMAP.md `## Backlog` section

6. **Commit changes:**
   ```bash
   gsd-sdk query commit "docs: review backlog — promoted N, removed M" --files .planning/ROADMAP.md
   ```

7. **Report summary:**
   ```
   ## 📋 Backlog Review Complete

   Promoted: {list of promoted items with new phase numbers}
   Kept: {list of items remaining in backlog}
   Removed: {list of deleted items}
   ```

</process>
